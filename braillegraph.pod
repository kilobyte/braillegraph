=head1 NAME

braillegraph - a simple histogram tool that produces text output

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<braillegraph> E<lt>I<data series>

B<psql> B<-At> B<-c> 'select ...' B<|>B<braillegraph>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<braillegraph> takes a single data series and plots them abusing the
Braille range (U+2800..U+28FF).  It is able to display two values per a
horizontal character, thus a plain text mail can hold an X range up to ~150
data points.  The vertical resolution is 4/character, thus a reasonable Y
range is up to 80ish.

No scaling is done at all — one dot is exactly one data point horizontally,
a value of 1 vertically.  The upside of this is that you get full control,
the downside is that you need to fully control it.

Input is given as one non-negative integer per line.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 psql bugs -A -t -c "
 select
     count(case when arch='amd64 (x86_64)' then 1 else null end)
     *80/count(*)
 from (select arch, date_trunc('month', timestamp) as month from si) m
 group by month
 order by month
